## The notes i've taken while relearning Git and Github.

Commands:
    - git clone (url)
    // is the method to clone the repository stored on github 
    to your local machine and make changes. 
    - git add .
    // tells git to track all files that have recieved a change, done usally 
    before a commit to allow git commits to save all changes
