## The notes i've taken while relearning Git and Github.

Commands:
    - git clone (url)
    // is the method to clone the repository stored on github 
    to your local machine and make changes. 
    - git add .
    // tells git to track all files that have recieved a change, done usally 
    before a commit to allow git commits to save all changes    
    - git commit -m "message"
    // saves all changes from local machine and prepares them to be sent to the online git repository
    the message usally describes the changes that have been made or some description of the changes.
    - git push
    // sends all saved changes from local machine to the online git repository.
    - git init
    //intialises a new github repository using a locally created folder.
    - git checkout -b (name)
    // makes a new branch with the name that has been input
    -git checkout (name_of_branch)
    //switches between branches 
    -git diff (name_of_branch)
    // shows the changes made from the inputted branch to the current branch 
    -git pull
    // pulls all changes made to the online repository down to your local repository
    - git branch -d (name_of_branch)
    // deletes inputted branch
    -git merge (name_of_branch)
    // merges the changes from the inputted branche into the currrent branch, if a conflict occurs must be resolved before a successful merge 

    // different editors have different ways to resolve merge conflicts. 
    // pull requests can be resolved on the online repository, allows other members 
    of the project to review your code before pushing to master/main.
